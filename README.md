# Clean Desk
Clean Desk is a simple desktop cleaning and organizing script for macOS. It helps you tidy up your desktop by automatically creating folders for different file types and moving files into their respective folders. Additionally, you can archive your entire desktop into a zip file with the current date, providing a backup for future reference.
